You can buildinteractive stories, simple games, animated music videos, or interactiveartwork. Using a special hardware interface and readily available Legocomponents, youcan use switches and various kinds of sensors to control yourcreations, or you could even create a kinetic sculpture that responds tothe viewer.<p>Like Lego or Tinkertoy, Scratch comes with a small set of building blocksthat can be combined in infinite ways to make your own creations. With Lego,you sometimes run out of a particular shape or color of building block,but in Scratch you never run out of objects because you can always makenew ones.<p>The Scratch building blocks are three basic objects: sounds, sprites,and image boxes. Sound objects let you record, edit, and play short soundsthat can be used to for sound effects, character voices, or music.Sprite objects are images that can move, rotate, and change size. Theyare useful as characters in interactive stories or as elements in games.Image box objects can used for playing movies, manipulating still images(e.g., to create a slide show), or playing MP3 sounds. <p>At the heart of Scratch is a simple, drag-n-drop scripting system thatlet's you control the things you make. Scripts are assembled from colorfulcommand blocks. It's very easy to get started yet there's plenty of powerto handle more advanced projects as your skills improve.<p>Scratch is designed to be used without much instruction and certainly withouta lengthy manual. Ideally, you'll have someone show you how to get started andthen you'd learn on your own by exploration. However, sometimesyou need a little help getting started, a reminder of where to find somefeature, or a hint about how to do something more advanced.That's where this guide can help.<p>Enough words! On to some pictures...<h2> Scratch Window </h2><p>When you first open Scratch, you'll see this window:<p><center> <img SRC="ScratchPanes.gif"> </center><ul><li> The dividers between panes can be dragged. </li><li> The stop button stops everything: scripts, music, and movie playback. </li><li> The object creation buttons create new sound, sprite, or image box objects. </li><li> Usually the blocks pane and the scripts pane show the blocks and scripts forthe same object, but they don't have to. Occasionally you'll need to drag a blockfrom one object into the script for a different object. There are several waysto control which object is viewed by each pane.</li></ul><h2> Scratch Menus </h2><p>To get started, make a new sprite (use the button with the cat icon),drop it into the work pane, and double-click on it. This will show thecommand blocks and scripts for that sprite. Here's an annotated picture ofwhat you'll see with all the menus expanded out for easy reference:<p><center> <img SRC="ScratchMenus.gif"> </center><ul><li>Your sprite'sname will probably be different that the one shown; Scratch makes upa new name for every object you create. You can changethe name by clicking on it in either the blocks or scripts pane.</li><li>The Scratch menu button lets you open and save Scratch projects, clear pentrails (see the "pen down" sprite command), or set the single-stepping mode.Single-stepping lets you see your scripts run in slow motion, which issometimes helpful when you're looking for a problem.</li><li>The blocks pane shows all the commands and variables for the selectedsprite. The commands are organized into categories. Click onthe white circle with the downward-pointing arrow to choose thecatetory to view.</li><li>The scripts menu lets you make a new script hat. Every script startswith a hat. The hat lets you name the script and gives you a way tostart and stop the script. The cleanup command arranges your scriptsin a long row so you can scroll through them easily.</li></ul><h2> Object Menus </h2><p>Each object has its own menu which you get by clicking the right mouse buttonon it (or option-clicking on a Macintosh). Here are the menus for sound,sprite, and image box objects:<p><center> <img SRC="ObjectMenus.gif"> </center><ul><li> View blocks and view scripts let you view the blocks or scripts for this object withoutchanging the other pane. This is useful when you wish to use blocks from one objectin another object's scripts.</li><li> Copy and delete do what they say. When you copy an object, all it's scriptsare copied as well. You can then change the scripts of either object withouteffecting the scripts of the other one.</li><li> Loading from a file loads the appropriate media into the the object. Sound objectscan load AIF or WAV audio files (but not MP3 files yet). Sprites canload still images from GIF, BMP, or JPG files. Image boxes can load MPG movies,MP3 files, or still images from GIF, BMP, or JPG files. Image boxes allowyou to play an MP3 file, although you can't record or edit it.</li><li> If you have microphone, you can record your own sound and thenedit it with a simple sound editor. Although Scratch doesn't limit thelength of sounds, the editor becomes slow with sounds longer than aminute or two. (We'll fix this problem in a later version of Scratch.)</li><li> Sprites can be edited with a simple painting editor. You can makeyour own sprites by editing with the default sprite picture.Another way to make custom sprite graphicsis to use the "grab from screen" command. For example, if you'vemade a cool pattern using the pen of a sprite you can grab and then edit it.</li><li> When a sprite turns, it spins around its "center ofrotation". When you edit a sprite, its center of rotation is set to thecenter of the picture you draw. Use the "set rotation center" commandif you want the sprite to rotate around some other point.</li><li> The default sprite turns as it's heading changes. This is great fortop-down views but bad for side views. The "set rotation style" command allowsyou to set the rotation style to "just flip left-right" or "don't rotate"which work better for side views.</li></ul><h2> Scripting Overview </h2><p>Scripts are created by dragging blocks from the blocks pane into thescripts pane of the object to be scripted. Blocks can be snapped togetherto create a sequence of commands that execute in order. A script startswith a "script hat", a purple block with the script's name and an indicatorthat turns green while the script is running or red if the script hasan error. Click on the script hat to start or stop that script.<p>Some command blocks have boxes containing numbers or other data. These boxes,called "parameters", specify inputs to the command. For example, the"turn" command has a parameter that says how many degrees the sprite turns.You can change a parameter just by clicking on it and editing it. Certainkinds of parameters, such as color parameters are set interactively,for example by picking a color from a color palette.<p>You can also drop variable blocks or math blocks onto a parameter touse the value of that variable or the result of that math operation asthe input to the command. Also, some blocks, such as "random" compute a value,just like the math blocks do. Such blocks are sometimes called "reporters".Reporter blocks can also be dropped into parameter boxes.<h2> Command Blocks Shared by All Objects </h2><p>This section describes the blocks that are shared by all the different kinds of objects.<h3> Control Blocks </h3><p>Control blocks are blocks that control the sequence or timing ofother command blocks. <p><center> <img SRC="ControlBlocks.gif"> </center><ul><li>The "if" block only executes the commands inside of itself if its parameteris true. For example, an "if" block can be used to make a ball spritedo something only when it touches a paddle sprite.</li><li>Scratch has four kinds of loop blocks that perform a set of commandsover and over. "Forever" does its commands until youmanually stop it. "Repeat" does its commands a fixed number of times."Until" and "while" do their commands either until their paremeter is trueor while it remains true.</li><li>"Wait" pauses the script for the given number of seconds.</li><li>"Done" and "answer" are used when you have one script calling another.They both leave the called script and continue with the next commandin the calling script. "Answer" also returns a value that canbe used by the calling script. (If these blocks seem confusing, don'tworry; you won't need them for a while.)</li></ul><h3> File Blocks </h3><p>File blocks allow your script to load or save media. For example, onecould make a slide show by loading a sequence ofimages or photos into an image box. "Save" can be used tostore a pictures or sound in a file.<p><center> <img SRC="FileBlocks.gif"> </center><h3> Math Blocks </h3><p>Math blocks let you do arithmetic and other math operations.<p><center> <img SRC="MathBlocks.gif"> </center><ul><li>The "+", "-", "*", and "/" blocks add, subtract, multiply,or divide their inputs. Note that dividing by zero is an error.If you accidentally do this, your script will stop and the indicatorwill turn red to show that an error has occured. After you've fixedthe problem you can just click the script hat to run the scriptagain.</li><li>The "mod" block computes the first number modulo the second. For example, "9 mod 6" is 3.Like divide, it is an error if the second input to "mod" is zero.</li><li>The "random" block chooses a random number between its first and second inputs. It givesa different answer each time it is run. "Random" can be very useful in creating gameswhere there is an element of chance. For example, you can use itto program a dice roll.</li><li>The "point" block makes a point object from two numbers. A few blocks,such as "go to," take a point as their input.</li><li>The "copy" block makes a duplicate of a sprite or other object. Thiscan be used to make a bunch of similar objects, such as the bricks fora breakout game.</li></ul><h3> Mouse and Keyboard Blocks </h3><p>These blocks let you control things using the mouse or keyboard entry.<p><center> <img SRC="MouseKeyboardBlocks.gif"> </center><ul><li>The "mouse pressed?" block reports true while any mouse button is pressed.</li><li>The "mouse position" block reports the current mouse position (a point).</li><li>The "key available?" block reports true if the user has typed a letter, number,or symbol on the keyboard. Certain keys, such as shift, control, and alt donot make a key available by themselves; they need to be combined with another key.</li><li>The "get key" block reports the letter, number, or symbol that the usertyped. Each time it runs, it gets the next key. So if the user types "cat"then the next three times "get key" runs it will get "c", "a", and "t" inthat order.</li></ul><h3> Testing Blocks </h3><p>Testing blocks are used to compare numbers or to combineseveral true-or-false values.<p><center> <img SRC="TestingBlocks.gif"> </center><ul><li>The "<", "=", and ">" blocks compare two numbers and report true ifthe first number is less than, equal to, or greater than the second.<li>The "and" block reports true only if BOTH of its inputs are true.<li>The "or" block reports true if at least one of its inputs is true.<li>The "not" block reports true if its input is false or false if itsinput is true. (It's a very contrary block!)</ul><h2> Sprite Command Blocks and Variables </h2><p>Sprites are objects that can move, rotate, and change size.<h3> Sprite Motion Blocks </h3><p><center> <img SRC="SpriteMotionBlocks.gif"> </center><h3> Sprite Sensing Blocks </h3><p><center> <img SRC="SpriteSensingBlocks.gif"> </center><h3> Sprite Variables </h3><p><center> <img SRC="SpriteVariables.gif"> </center><h2> Sound Command Blocks and Variables </h2><p>Sounds objects are used for short (less than two or three minutes) sounds.<h3> Sound Playing Blocks </h3><p><center> <img SRC="SoundPlayingBlocks.gif"> </center><h3> Sound Variables </h3><p><center> <img SRC="SoundVariables.gif"> </center><h2> Image Box Command Blocks and Variables </h2><p>Image box objects can hold still images, MPEG movies, or MP3 sounds. The image ormovie can be panned, zoomed, or faded to a sold color (e.g. fade to black).<h3> Image Box Movie Blocks </h3><p><center> <img SRC="ImageBoxMovieBlocks.gif"> </center><h3> Image Box Variables </h3><p><center> <img SRC="ImageBoxVariables.gif"> </center></body></html>
