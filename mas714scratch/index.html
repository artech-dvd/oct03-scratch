Sample projects can bedownloaded separately (see below).<p><h2>Unpack</h2><p>On Windows, unpack the file using WinZip. On Mac, use StuffIt Expander.Once it's been uncompressed, the folder contains all the files you needto run Scratch.<p><h2>Run</h2><p>To run Scratch, double-click on "Scratch.exe" or "MacScratch".To exit, use the Windows close box or the Mac Quit command.<p><h3>Trouble-Shooting</h3><p>If double-clicking does not start Scratch, you can try dropping the file"squeak.image" onto "Scratch.exe" or "MacScratch".The Mac version does run in compatibility mode under OS X. Thesound stutters, but everything else works okay.<p>If you have any problems, send me email at jmaloney at media.mit.edu.<p><h2>Documentation</h2><p>The file "HowToRunScratch.txt" included in the package will help you get started.Here is the start of an online manual:<p><a href="./ScratchDoc/ScratchDoc.html"> Scratch: A Pictoral Guide</a><p><h2>Sample Projects</h2><p>Here is a set of sample projects. Unpack and place all files into the folderwith Scratch:<p>Windows: <a href="ScratchProjects1.zip"> ScratchProjects1.zip</a> (272k).<br>Mac: <a href="ScratchProjects1.sit"> ScratchProjects1.sit</a> (268k).<p>Here are the projects done for class. Mac users should be able unpack thisfile using StuffIt Expander. Place all files into the folderwith Scratch:<p><a href="ScratchClassProjects.zip"> ScratchClassProjects.zip</a> (4.7 megabytes)<p>The large file size is due to three mp3 music files.<p><h2>Sample MPEG Movies (optional)</h2><p>Here are several sample MPEG movies for use with the Scratch image box:<p><a href="Bear3.mpg"> Bear3.mpg</a> (1.3 megabytes).<br><a href="GromitBreakfast.mpg"> GromitBreakfast.mpg</a> (1.5 megabytes).<p>Of course, you can use any standard MPEG movies you happen to have or downloadfrom the web.
